<h3>Product Specification</h3>
<p> <strong><a href="http://www.isweek.com/product/so-e2-050-limiting-current-type-sensor-oxygen-sensors-so-e2-050_2096.html">SO-E2-050</a></strong><br />
  <strong>Limiting Current Type Sensor Oxygen Sensors</strong></p>
<p> When voltage is applied to a zirconia   electrolyte cell, oxygen is pumped through the zirconia disc from the   cathode side to the anode side because the carriers of the current   flowing through the zirconia electrolyte are oxygen ions. By attaching a   cap with a pinhole on the cathode side of the cell and by increasing   the voltage over the cell the current shows saturation due to the rate   limiting step in the transfer of oxygen to the cathode. This saturation   current is called limiting current and is nearly proportional to the   ambient oxygen concentration.</p>
<p> <strong>Below the advantages of the oxygen sensor:</strong><br />
  measuring range 0.05 to 5 vol.% oxygen<span id="__kindeditor_bookmark_start_57__"> </span><br />
  High accuracy<br />
  For many types a more or less linear characteristic<br />
  Small temperature dependence of the sensor signal<br />
  Low interference with other gases<br />
  Long service life<br />
  In many cases &ldquo;Single point calibration&ldquo; necessary only once</p>
<p> <strong>Applications:</strong><br />
  Medical<br />
  Laboratory<br />
  Food industry<br />
  Household/Gastronomy<br />
  Measuring technique<br />
  Security technology/Monitoring<br />
  (Electrical-) industry</p>
<p> <strong>Characteristic Data:</strong><br />
  Measuring gas: Oxygen concentration<br />
  Measuring medium: Gaseous atmosphere<br />
  Measuring principle: Limiting current type sensor<br />
  Measuring ranges: 0.05 – 5.0 vol.% O2<br />
  Response time (t90): 2 to 25 sec. (Depends on: sensor type, gas flow, measuring chamber)<br />
  Sensor voltage / heating voltage / power consumption / heater cold resistance<br />
  Sensor voltage: 0.7 to 1.6 Volt<br />
  Heating voltage: 3.6 – 4.4 Volts<br />
  Power consumption: 1.3 to 1.8 Watts (depends on application and packaging)<br />
Cold resistance:  R( 25°C ) = 3.25Ω ± 0.20Ω </p>
<p> Warm up time: Min. 30 s<br />
  Maximum permissible operating temperature: 350°C (*)<br />
  *Depending on the cable and filter assembly (see paragraph: specification, Cable assembly) </p>
<p> Permissible volumetric flow rate (Purging the sensor)<br />
  For all sensor types, the maximum flow   rate depends on the way of purging the sensor (sensor in direct gas   flow, gas beam shape, etc.) and the size of the measuring chamber.   Exception: SO-E1-xxx (TO8 + hose connection for direct gassing).   Permissible flow<br />
  [ml/min]: 100 - 500 (optimal: 250) </p>
<p> Lifetime (MTTF): ~ 20.000 hours (*)<br />
  *Depending on measuring medium. Stated   lifetime refers to a heated, operated sensor of type SO-xx-250 and   SO-xx-960. A failure or reaching the lifetime typically means a slight   deviation from the dispatch specifications. </p>
<p> Vibration resistance<br />
  Sensors based on the TO8 socket as   well as those built with a TO39 socket (SO-Bx-xxx, SO-Ex-xxx, SO-Ax-xxx)   meet the European Norm EN60068-2-6 (Sinusoidal vibration tests).</p>
